# Fontima

>Optimize your Google Fonts requests

## About

**[Fontima](https://fontima.com/) delivers fine-grained CSS** for the fonts and characters you need, it is possible to **save up to 90%** on requests (CSS + WOFF2).

## Why use Fontima?

>If you can not measure it, you can not improve it. -Lord Kelvin

We often attack images with a battery of optimization tools, what we don't realize is that fonts are as large or even larger than images. Fontima *requests font subsets* and *optimizes those requests* on the fly if possible. *Useful feedback* such as **how much you saved**, missing characters, heavier files, and font preview are some of its features.

## When to use Fontima?

Use it as long as you **have a clear idea of what the characters wearing a given font will be**. Practical examples: a web/app logo; a set of math symbols; or even a set of languages (in case the web/app is not intended to be worldwide used e.g.: a local web or a private business app).

## How to use Fontima?

1. Bring the code given by Google Fonts;
1. Choose the characters you need;
1. Get your optimized CSS.

That's it!

## Pros and Cons

✅ Pros:

- **Less bytes**;
- **Less request**, potentially;
- **Feedback**, the actual improvement.

❌ Cons:

- **Static CSS**;
- Possible **false positive characters**.
- Some **variable fonts can not optimized by GF**.
